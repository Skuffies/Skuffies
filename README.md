### Hi I'm Skuffies ðŸ‘‹

I recently started with both photography and programming. I haven't yet finished or published anything but hope to do so in the future. With my short experience of using Github I can safely say I like it and will continue to use it. I currently use Visual Studio 2019 and Unity for the majority of my projects.
